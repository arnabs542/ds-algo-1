/*
Find nth Magic Number
Problem Description

Given an integer A, find and return the Ath magic number.

A magic number is defined as a number which can be expressed as a power of 5 or sum of unique powers of 5.

First few magic numbers are 5, 25, 30(5 + 25), 125, 130(125 + 5), â€¦.



Problem Constraints
1 <= A <= 5000



Input Format
The only argument given is integer A.



Output Format
Return the Ath magic number.



Example Input
Example Input 1:

 A = 3
Example Input 2:

 A = 10


Example Output
Example Output 1:

 30
Example Output 2:

 650


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 A in increasing order is [5, 25, 30, 125, 130, ...]
 3rd element in this is 30
Explanation 2:

 In the sequence shown in explanation 1, 10th element will be 650.
